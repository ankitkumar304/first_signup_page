## Introduction

The Playfair cipher or Playfair square or Wheatstone–Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair for promoting its use. In playfair cipher unlike traditional cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.Playfair  ciphers  are relatively  less  complex From  the  computational  and hardware point of view, more complex algorithms require more  power  consumption,  which  make  them  less attractive  for  use  in  wireless  devices  such  as  mobile phones, wireless sensor, etc. In contrast, Playfair cipher, being  comparatively  simpler  than  their  more  complex counterparts, are low power consumption algorithms and therefore  are  suitable  for  data  security  in  wireless applications.
## RESEARCH

## Features
- The Playfair cipher uses a 5×5 grid of letters, and encrypts a message by breaking the text into pairs of letters and swapping them according to their positions in a rectangle within that grid: 
- In playfair cipher unlike traditional cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.
## State of Art
yet not done

# SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strengths
- It is a generalized and modified play fair cipher, which will suit any language.
- The proposed cipher will also suit for all the applications having odd number of characters.
- Unlike all previous versions,the proposed play fair can also contain any number of characters.  
- It will be able to divide any given plain text(even or odd)into the pair of characters.
- It will be more secure.It contains confusion and diffusion.
## Weaknesses
- It considers the letters I and J as one character. 
- 26  letters  alone  can  take  as  keyword  without duplicates.  
- Space between two words in the plaintext is not considered as one character.
- It cannot use special characters and numbers.
## Opportunities
- it will be able to encrypt plain text of any natural language.
# 4W and 1H
## What
- The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher.it will be able to encrypt plain text of any natural language.In playfair cipher unlike traditional       cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.
## Why
- Playfair cipher is the first and best-known digraph substitution cipher, which uses the technique of symmetry encryption, and if anyone need secreat conversation on that time 
  playfair can be use.

## Where
- When the two or more than two person aur want to talk privately on that time this technique is used. 
- This technique is not used for business purpose because this technique is easily decrypted when anyone have idea about this Technique.  
## How
- First of all identify the number of characters in the language.
- Identify the  size  of  the  generalized  matrix. 
- Create Diagraphs.
- Build  mapping  of  the  characters  with  the Unicode.
- Fill all the cells  of  the generalized matrix  with the characters.
- Select a key and perform the encryption.
